so, I think we should structure this way: 

level 0: 
folders per page category + main pages (page groups)
i.e the ones that can be accessed directly from the index without going too deep
folder default - to store everything accessible by everypage

level 1: 
folders for the perpage contents

level 2: 
folders in folders - for page groups and additional functionality
