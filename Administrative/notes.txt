Notes: 7 July
1.
What happens when another use is coming 
change the idea - so that the given activity should count the number of places not based on the total/2 but the 
total - reserved places

	1. The Visitor wants to enter - we need to update everything dynamically 
	the label should be updated!
	2. this is confusing - the app is not for the reservation, but for the entrance control

	checking we made through the location history table
	how does it work - who is the main form
2.
camping entrance
	both are called camping entry and camping entry... 
	shown the table 
	closing of the entry terminates the rfid reader
		{should we check this}
	cool - that timer thing is nice for checking
we have obe entry fot the loc hostory on entrance and exit not 2
9940 - x = 9880??? why sixty? 
it's perfect to give two modes
we fix the camping to the one leader
3. 
hristian - loaning items app
...l
we load the items in the list box 
troubles wih the rfid - rebuilt
